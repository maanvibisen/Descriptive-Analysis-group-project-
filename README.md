This practical is based on analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Data using visualization and transformation tools. 
The dataset includes details such as vehicle category (2-Wheelers, 4-Wheelers), makers (BMW India, OLA Electric, 
BYD India, etc.), sales by states, penetration rates, CAGR, and monthly trends. The objective is to clean, transform, 
and visualize the dataset to understand the growth, sales performance, and market trends of electric vehicles in 
India.
